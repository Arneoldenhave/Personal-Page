<h1> My personal journey</h1>
<p> Throughout the years I've devoted myself to the accumulaion of skills and knwoledge. </p>
<p> Anything I find interesting I persue with relentless passion. Whether it's music or oplitical philosophy I try to learn as much about it as possible. </p>

Her restaurant is where I started my career in the Kitchen. As I turned 20 years old I decided to take it more seriously and start an individual career in professianal kitchens. These kitchens are where I learned to work in a team and how to manag responsiblity. After I graduated from University I decied to quit the kitchen and start new part pf my life.
